 is no longer the same. We miss the great Roger Ailes. You have more anti-Trump people, by far, than ever before. Looking for a new outlet!

@IngrahamAngle Laura what is the problem with your irresponsible colleague @TeamCavuto ?? Apparently he never read the French study or Dr. Stephen Smith's experience on this. Your colleagues at @FoxNews might as well be on @cnn because all they do is spew #FakeNews about @POTUS twitter.com/Breaking911/st…

I can't keep tweeting this enough because the sheer stupidity of what Cavuto said boggles the mind. He claimed that if you have any respiratory ailments, #Hydroxychloroquine WILL KILL YOU!

That is an utterly false statement with no scientific basis in fact. #Fearporn fiction.

Calling out Sen. Susan Collins of Maine in a Tweet (https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1262205050472009729?s=20)

Going after the WHO (https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1262577580718395393?s=20)

And oing after Obama and the FBI in TWO tweets lately (https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1262183198827712512?s=20), (https://twitter.com/KamVTV/status/1262180883446018049?s=20)

To give credit where credit is due, he's announced deals with both DC and San Fransisco (https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1262781525260734467?s=20), (https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1262780670709043200?s=20), and, he was not 100% incorrect about this CNN employee taking off her mask during the press briefing (https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1262156409128583168?s=20), though, that would be a first.
